<h2>Working on a team</h2>

<p>Despite being a small team,<br/>
we've experienced typical team type problems</p>
<ul>
    <li class="fragment">FTP</li>
    <li class="fragment">Plugin version mismatching</li>
    <li class="fragment">Overwritten files</li>
    <li class="fragment">Missing source SCSS files</li>
</ul>

<aside class="notes">
    <strong>ftp</strong> always having to download entire sites over and over<br>
    <strong>plugins</strong> recreating environment with exact plugin versions, accidentally upgrading, rolling back,<br>
    <strong>overwritten files</strong> uploading out of date files, undoing each other's work, reintroducing bugs<br>
    <strong>missing source</strong> Actually have had compiled CSS on the server, and a version of the SCSS locally but multiple missing edits between compiled versions<br>
